# ChatGPT code

This code was created by ChatGPT with minor changes to make it compile and run.

To run [chapt_code.rs](./chatgpt_code.rs):
```
$ cargo run --example chatgpt_code

## A ChatGpt question

The original question and answer are gone and it consisted of 8 or so question/answers
to arrive at a workable solutijon. Here I asked a question that I thought would produce
the answer directly. And sure enough it almost did, just minor changes were needed to make
it work. Actually, I'm pretty sure I could have told it to remove the offending code and
it would have generated a working result.

Here is this revised question followed by the answser:
```
In Rust how to pass different struct messages to a function that takes a Box<dyn Any> as a parameter.
```

One way to pass different struct messages to a function that takes a Box<dyn Any> as a parameter is to use the std::any::Any trait. You can implement this trait for your structs and then use the boxed() method to create a Box<dyn Any> object.

Here is an example of how to do this:
```
use std::any::Any;

// Define your structs
struct Message1 {
    data: i32,
}

struct Message2 {
    data: String,
}

// Implement the Any trait for your structs
impl Any for Message1 {}
impl Any for Message2 {}

fn handle_message(message: Box<dyn Any>) {
    // Use the downcast_ref() method to extract the struct from the Box<dyn Any>
    if let Some(message1) = message.downcast_ref::<Message1>() {
        println!("Received message1 with data: {}", message1.data);
    } else if let Some(message2) = message.downcast_ref::<Message2>() {
        println!("Received message2 with data: {}", message2.data);
    } else {
        println!("Received unknown message");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let message1 = Message1 { data: 42 };
    let message2 = Message2 { data: "Hello".to_string() };

    // Use the boxed() method to create a Box<dyn Any> object
    let message1_boxed = Box::new(message1) as Box<dyn Any>;
    let message2_boxed = Box::new(message2) as Box<dyn Any>;

    handle_message(message1_boxed); // Output: Received message1 with data: 42
    handle_message(message2_boxed); // Output: Received message2 with data: Hello
}
```
Note that you can use the downcast_ref() method to extract the struct from the Box<dyn Any>. This method returns None if the struct inside the box is not of the expected type, so you can use it to check the type of the struct and handle it accordingly.

The minimum changes necessary to make the above code to work:

    handle_message(message1_boxed); // Output: Received message1 with data: 42

}
```
